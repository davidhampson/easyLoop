IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES A RESOURCES FILE WITH AN EXECUTABLE AND A WAV TO RUN,
AS WELL AS TWO FOLDERS ENTITLED "saves" and "tracks". IT WILL ATTEMPT TO CREATE THEM BUT IF IT
IS NOT GIVEN PERMISSIONS IT WILL QUIT AND YOU WILL NEED TO CREATE THEM. 
The jar is compiled directly from the code in the Source Code folder.

To begin, simply record or upload a wav (I have provided some for you). You can then set the pattern with
the syntax described in the program.

An integer plays the clip modulated by its (the integer's) pitch
"!" skips a repetition, essentially muting it.
"|" clumps nearby notes together, creating a chord
">" prevents the clip from stopping on the next repetition, doubling its length

EXAMPLE PATTERN: 0 0 | 4 | 7 -2 > ! 0 (Root, major chord, wholetone down for two beats, root)

To see examples of these used, you can load one of the example files I included. They are really quite
simple after you understand how they work

Enjoy!

NOTE: For some reason, there are some .wav files that Java can not read, so
if you are having trouble with using your personal .wav files, feel free to use the ones I packed.
